Title = {{Three decades of regulation of agricultural nitrogen losses: Experiences
   from the Danish Agricultural Monitoring Program}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{787}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Excess nitrogen (N) losses from intensive agricultural production are a
   world-wide problem causing eutrophication in vulnerable aquatic
   ecosystems such as estuaries. Therefore, Denmark as one of the most
   intensively farmed countries in the world has enforced mandatory
   regulations on agricultural production since the late 1980s. We
   demonstrate the outcome of the regulations imposed on agriculture by
   analyzing decadal trends in nitrate (NO3-) concentrations and loads in
   streams using 29 years of detailed monitoring data and survey
   information on agricultural practices at field level from five
   intensively cultivated headwater catchments. The analysis includes the
   importance of four main drivers (climate, land use, agricultural
   practices, and biogeophysical properties of catchments), each divided
   into different factors that may influence stream NO3- loads during three
   subperiods defined by the time of introduction of different mitigation
   measures: i) 1990-1998, ii) 1999-2007, and iii) 2008-2018.
   Significant correlations with annual flow-weighted stream NO3-
   concentrations and/or loads were found for factors representing all of
   the four main drivers including precipitation, large scale climate
   fluctuations, runoff, previous year's runoff, baseflow index, number of
   annual frost days, agricultural area, livestock density, field N
   surplus, catch crop cover, manure storage capacity, method and time of
   manure spreading, and time of soil tillage. Changes in the four drivers
   were reflected by the load-runoff (L-Q) relationships for each of the
   three subperiods within each of the five headwater catchments. The five
   catchments experienced large but catchment-specific downward shifts in
   the L-Q relationship attributable to changes in land use and
   agricultural management within the catchments. The documented large
   downward shifts in NO3- loads demonstrated for the five catchments
   (30-52\%) as a consequence of mandatory regulation over a period of
   nearly three decades are a unique example of how agriculture can reduce
   its environmental impact. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   Assessment?}},
Journal = {{AGRONOMY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{It is vital for farmers to know if their land is suitable for the crops
   that they plan to grow. An increasing number of studies have used
   machine learning models based on land use data as an efficient means for
   mapping land suitability. This approach relies on the assumption that
   farmers grow their crops in the best-suited areas, but no studies have
   systematically tested this assumption. We aimed to test the assumption
   for specialty crops in Denmark. First, we mapped suitability for 41
   specialty crops using machine learning. Then, we compared the predicted
   land suitabilities with the mechanistic model ECOCROP (Ecological Crop
   Requirements). The results showed that there was little agreement
   between the suitabilities based on machine learning and ECOCROP.
   Therefore, we argue that the methods represent different phenomena,
   which we label as socioeconomic suitability and ecological suitability,
   respectively. In most cases, machine learning predicts socioeconomic
   suitability, but the ambiguity of the term land suitability can lead to
   misinterpretation. Therefore, we highlight the need for increasing
   awareness of this distinction as a way forward for agricultural land
   suitability assessment.}},

Title = {{Land-use and agriculture in Denmark around year 1900 and the quest for
   EU Water Framework Directive reference conditions in coastal waters}},
Journal = {{AMBIO}},
Abstract = {{The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to protect the ecological
   status of coastal waters. To establish acceptable boundaries between
   good and moderate ecological status, the WFD calls for reference
   conditions practically undisturbed by human impact. For Denmark, the
   nitrogen (N) concentrations present around year 1900 have been suggested
   to represent reference conditions. As the N load of coastal waters
   relates closely to runoff from land, any reduction in load links to
   agricultural activity. We challenge the current use of historical N
   balances to establish WFD reference conditions and initiate an
   alternative approach based on parish-level land-use statistics collected
   1896/1900 and N concentrations in root zone percolates from experiments
   with year 1900-relevant management. This approach may be more widely
   applicable for landscapes with detailed historic information on
   agricultural activity. Using this approach, we find an average N
   concentration in root zone percolates that is close to that of current
   agriculture. Thus, considering Danish coastal waters to be practically
   unaffected by human activity around year 1900 remains futile as 75\% of
   the land area was subject to agricultural activity with a substantial
   potential for N loss to the environment. It appears unlikely that the
   ecological state of coastal waters around year 1900 may serve as WFD
   reference condition.}},

   grain crops from 1990-2015}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{118}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The content of crude protein in grain decreased 2.4-2.9 percentage
   points (dry matter basis) in Denmark between 1990 and 2015. The aim of
   this model analysis was to quantify to which extent the reduced crude
   protein content in winter wheat and spring barley was caused by a)
   changed N-response in new varieties, b) changed fertilizer norms, field
   management and N-deposition, c) decreased N-mineralization due to
   structural changes in Danish farming, and d) warmer and wetter weather.
   The analysis was carried out using the plant-soil-atmosphere model
   DAISY. It was possible to simulate most of the observed change in
   protein content. For winter wheat, changes in fertilizer regulations
   driven by environmental concerns and accompanied by a drop in aerial
   deposition of nitrogen explained between 50 and 70 \% of the total
   simulated decline in crude protein content. The changed N-response of
   new varieties explained 15-20 \%. For spring barley, the changed
   N-response accounted for 45-60 \% of the observed change under mineral
   fertilization and 40-45 \% in scenarios receiving slurry. Warmer and
   wetter weather accounted for around 20 \% of the change for both crops.
   On the more clayey soils, reduced mineralisation influenced the protein
   content, and this effect was probably underestimated in the study.}},

Title = {{Using spatial multi-criteria decision analysis to develop new and

   Denmark}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{34-42}},

Abstract = {{Close to 60 per cent of the Danish land area is used for arable farming.
   EU regulations as well as public preferences create increasing pressures
   for changing agricultural land use in a more environmentally sustainable
   direction incorporating the multiple ecosystem services affected by
   agriculture. In this paper we present a spatially explicit
   multi-criteria decision analysis model which describes the trade-offs
   between the rent obtained from land in agricultural use on the one hand
   and selected ecosystem services on the other. The model is based on an
   extensive geographical dataset. This include maps on soil types, carbon
   content, sensitivity to nutrient losses, High Nature Value scores etc.,
   which in combination with environmental criteria facilitates the ranking
   of all agricultural fields in Denmark according to their current overall
   worth to society in terms of land rent as well as other ecosystem
   services. Picking from a ranked list, we identify areas that may be
   considered efficient candidates for land use change considerations.
   Subsequently, the model is applied to identify suitable candidate areas
   for land use change in scenarios attaching different weights to various
   environmental services. In this way, four scenarios for Danish
   agricultural land use in 2050 are analysed. The results highlight that
   the possible realization of each of these mutually exclusive scenarios
   will require decision makers to consider very different development
   paths and land use changes for the Danish agricultural area.}},

Title = {{Abating N in Nordic agriculture - Policy, measures and way forward}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{236}},
Pages = {{674-686}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{During the past twenty years, the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden,
   Finland and Norway) have introduced a range of measures to reduce losses
   of nitrogen (N) to air and to aquatic environment by leaching and
   runoff. However, the agricultural sector is still an important N source
   to the environment, and projections indicate relatively small emission
   reductions in the coming years.
   The four Nordic countries have different priorities and strategies
   regarding agricultural N flows and mitigation measures, and therefore
   they are facing different challenges and barriers. In Norway farm
   subsidies are used to encourage measures, but these are mainly focused
   on phosphorus (P). In contrast, Denmark targets N and uses control
   regulations to reduce losses. In Sweden and Finland, both voluntary
   actions combined with subsidies help to mitigate both N and P.
   The aim of this study was to compare the present situation pertaining to
   agricultural N in the Nordic countries as well as to provide
   recommendations for policy instruments to achieve cost effective
   abatement of reactive N from agriculture in the Nordic countries, and to
   provide guidance to other countries.
   To further reduce N losses from agriculture, the four countries will
   have to continue to take different routes. In particular, some countries
   will need new actions if 2020 and 2030 National Emissions Ceilings
   Directive (NECD) targets are to be met. Many options are possible,
   including voluntary action, regulation, taxation and subsidies, but the
   difficulty is finding the right balance between these policy options for
   each country.
   The governments in the Nordic countries should put more attention to the
   NECD and consult with relevant stakeholders, researchers and farmer's
   associations on which measures to prioritize to achieve these goals on
   time. It is important to pick remaining low hanging fruits through use
   of the most cost effective mitigation measures. We suggest that N
   application rate and its timing should be in accordance with the crop
   need and carrying capacity of environmental recipients. Also, the choice
   of application technology can further reduce the risk of N losses into
   air and waters. This may require more region-specific solutions and
   knowledge-based support with tailored information in combination with
   further targeted subsidies or regulations.}},

Abstract = {{Uptake of energy crop production is slow, even though the returns are
   competitive with traditional crops, suggesting the existence of barriers
   to adoption. Danish farm-level data from 2006 to 2013 are used to
   identify incentive mechanisms and potential barriers to uptake. The
   results identify land quality, existing farm activities and local
   markets as important conditions. The influence of farm size and the
   decisions of neighbouring farmers suggest more subtle barriers: learning
   costs, uncertainties about future markets and start-up costs. The study
   thus points towards some of the underlying barriers for the uptake of
   energy crops and potential new policy directions.}},

Abstract = {{The 2020 EU biodiversity strategy aims to halt the loss of biodiversity
   and ecosystem services, but this requires effective monitoring to
   determine whether these aims are achieved. Common bird monitoring
   continuously assesses changes in the avian community providing a
   powerful tool for monitoring temporal changes in the abundance and
   distribution of these upper trophic level consumers. Two-thirds of
   Denmark's land area is intensively farmed, so agricultural habitats make
   a major contribution to Danish biodiversity. We looked for changes in
   abundance amongst farmland birds in Denmark during 1987-2014 to test for
   reductions in declines and to predict whether the 2020-target can be
   expected to be achieved. Sixteen specialist farmland species were those
   showing the most rapid declines amongst 102 common breeding species in
   Denmark. Of these, those species nesting on the ground showed
   significant long-term declines, which was not the case for those that
   nest elsewhere, i.e. in hedgerows, trees and buildings. There was no
   evidence to suggest that these trends were attributable to widespread
   declines in long-distance migrant species (as reported elsewhere), which
   may be affected by conditions at other times in the annual cycle. We
   therefore conclude that continued declines in specialist farmland
   breeding bird species are due to contemporary agricultural changes
   within Denmark and urge habitat- and species-specific analysis to
   identify the core causes of these changes and halt the declines.}},

   Despite these efforts, adoption is still lagging behind
   expectations.Whether farmers adopt PA or not is likely to be influenced
   by several factors. This study intends to identify the main
   socio-economic determinants of adoption of precision agriculture in
   Denmark and Germany employing a binary logit model on a cross-section

   groundwater dominated catchment}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{595}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Denmark must further decrease the N-load to coastal waters from
   agricultural areas to comply with the Baltic Sea Action Plan and the EU
   Water Framework Directive. A new spatially targeted regulation is under
   development that focuses on locating N-mitigation measures in areas with
   low natural reduction of nitrate (N-reduction). A key tool in this
   respect is N-reduction maps showing how much N is removed by natural
   reduction processes, i.e. the ratio between the N-load out of the
   catchment and the N-leaching from the root zone for each spatial unit
   within the catchment. For the 85 km(2) groundwater dominated Norsminde
   catchment in Denmark we have analysed the potential benefits of a
   spatially targeted regulation and how its efficiency is affected by
   uncertainty in the N-reduction map. Our results suggest that there are
   potential benefits of implementing a spatially targeted regulation
   compared to a spatially uniform regulation. The total N-load at the
   catchment outlet can be decreased up to 8\% by relocating the existing
   agricultural practice according to the N-reduction map and thus without
   decrease fertilization inputs. A further decrease in N-load can be
   obtained by identifying target areas with low N-reduction where
   N-mitigation measures must be applied. Uncertainty on the N-reduction
   map is found to lower the efficiency of spatially targeted regulation.
   This uncertainty can be lowered substantially by using the mean of an
   ensemble of N-reduction maps. The uncertainty decreases with coarser
   spatial resolution of the N-reduction map, but this will at the same
   time decrease the benefit from spatially targeted regulation. (C) 2017

   agricultural measures from a legal and regulatory perspective}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{98-106}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in the implementation of the Water Framework
   Directive (WFD) is how to address diffuse agricultural pollution of the
   aquatic environment. In Denmark the implementation of agricultural
   measures has been fraught with difficulty in the form of delays and
   legal proceedings, despite an ambitious starting point. Why has the
   implementation of the WFD been so difficult? Based on an analysis of
   three core components (effectiveness, scale and legal issues) of three
   agricultural measures (riparian zones, reduced management of streams and
   catch crops), the paper argues that the legal and regulatory complexity
   of adopting mandatory land use related measures at the national level to
   achieve site-specific environmental objectives was underestimated in a
   top-down political process. The ambitious mandatory policy measures,
   which added to existing high regulation pressure, led to regulatory
   challenges, such as possible violation of private property rights
   raising questions about the actual environmental effects at local level.
   Consequently, political acceptability and legitimacy of the agricultural
   measures were undermined, resulting in a gradual withdrawal of the
   measures and a policy failure. It is argued that the adoption of more
   flexible measures to be implemented at the local level could have
   resulted in fewer difficulties from an economic and legal point of view
   as measures could have been applied where there was a clear
   environmental benefit, and possibly also at a lower cost.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{93-101}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Farmers are key actors in land management confronted with society's
   increasing demand for public goods. Understanding farmers' values and
   motivations is essential to policy makers to foster more sustainable
   production practices. So far, no definite value profile for European
   farmers exists. Based on Schwartz's theory of basic human values, we
   statistically analyzed six rounds of the European Social Survey to
   explore farmers' value orientations in Austria, Denmark, Finland,
   Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. Our results revealed
   that farmers are less open to change and instead more conservative in
   their value orientation than the general population. Comparison of value
   orientations across farmers showed that this value profile is
   particularly pronounced for Austrian, Finnish, and German farmers.
   Furthermore, there is a slight tendency for farmers to be less motivated
   by self-interest and instead more concerned with common welfare than the
   general population, but this observation needs further validation. Based
   on these value profiles, we argue that agri-environmental schemes will
   receive better acceptance when they represent a long-term modification
   of existing schemes, when they do not trade off commodity production,
   and when they provide benefits to society. Compensation for income
   losses resulting from reduced on-farm output appears to be an
   ineffective incentive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the case of Denmark-a country which historically
   had next to no domestic energy resources-for which new historical energy
   accounts are presented for the years 1800-1913. It demonstrates that
   Denmark's take-off at the end of the nineteenth century was relatively
   energy dependent. This is related to Denmark's well-known agricultural
   transformation and development through the dairy industry, and thus the
   article complements the literature which argues that expensive energy
   hindered industrialization, by arguing that similar obstacles would have
   precluded other countries from a more agriculture-based growth. The
   Danish cooperative creameries, which spread throughout the country over
   the last two decades of the nineteenth century, were dependent on coal.
   Although Denmark had next to no domestic coal deposits, this article
   demonstrates that Danish geography allowed cheap availability throughout
   the country through imports. On top of this it emphasizes that another
   important source of energy was imported feed for cows.}},

   with charcoal production for mining, extraction of timber and production
   of tar and pitch which have historically been important export
   commodities for Sweden, Norway, and Finland. In Denmark, conversion to
   agricultural land and the use of forests for livestock feeding was
   similarly important. During the subsequent reforestation efforts in
   Denmark, the introduction and use of non-autochthonous FRM of beech, oak
   and Scots pine became prevalent. Norway spruce FRM was extensively
   introduced to Sweden and Norway, and Scots pine FRM was imported to
   Sweden. Finland, in contrast, has limited records of FRM introductions.
   The importation of conifer seed to Norway and Sweden was initially
   driven by demand for large quantities of seed associated with the
   practice of direct seeding which prevailed until the mid-20th century.
   Large-scale changes to land ownership appear to have facilitated the
   logging of forests and subsequent seed imports for regeneration.
   Awareness of provenance variation in adaptive traits emerged gradually
   from the 19th century and led to more targeted imports of FRM to
   specifically improve climatic adaptation, trait qualities and growth,
   from the early 20th century. This, in turn, triggered the development of
   national regulations and guidelines from the 1930s to control the use of
   FRM, and marked a shift in forest legislation that had historically only
   been designed to control harvesting. Due to the geographical scales
   involved, transfers of FRM have unquestionably affected native gene
   pools, especially for species such as Norway spruce, Scots pine, beech,
   sessile and pedunculate oak, although relatively few examples of
   adaptive failures due to transfer have been reported.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decades a wide variety of tools have been developed to
   assess the sustainability performance of farms. Although multiple
   studies have compared tools on a theoretical basis, little attention has
   been paid to the comparing tools in practice. This research compared
   indicator-based sustainability assessment tools to gain insight in
   practical requirements, procedures and complexity involved in applying
   sustainability assessment tools. In addition, the relevance of the
   tools, as perceived by farmers, was evaluated. An overview of 48
   indicator-based sustainability assessment tools was developed to,
   subsequently, select tools that address the environmental, social and
   economic dimension of sustainability, are issued in a scientific
   publication and suitable for assessing the sustainability performance of
   livestock and arable farms in Denmark. Only four tools (RISE, SAFA, PG
   and IDEA) complied with the selection criteria and were used to assess
   the sustainability performance of five Danish farms. The tools vary
   widely in their scoring and aggregation method, time requirement and
   data input. The farmers perceived RISE as the most relevant tool to gain
   insight in the sustainability performance of their farm. The findings
   emphasize the importance of context specificity, user-friendliness,
   complexity of the tool, language use, and a match between value
   judgements of tool developers and farmers. Even though RISE was
   considered as the most relevant tool, the farmers expressed a hesitation
   to apply the outcomes of the four tools in their decision making and
   management. Furthermore, they identified limitations in their options to
   improve their sustainability performance. Additional efforts are needed
   to support farmers in using the outcomes in their decision making. The
   outcomes of sustainability assessment tools should therefore be
   considered as a starting point for discussion, reflection and learning.

Title = {{Economic gains from targeted measures related to non-point pollution in
   agriculture based on detailed nitrate reduction maps}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{556}},
Pages = {{264-275}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{From 1990 to 2003, Denmark reduced N-leaching from the root zone by
   50\%. However, more measures are required, and in recent years, the
   focus has been on how to differentiate measures in order to ensure that
   they are implemented where the effect on N-loss reductions per ha is the
   greatest. The purpose of the NiCA project has been to estimate the
   natural nitrate reduction in the ground water more precisely than before
   using a plot size down to 1 ha. This article builds on these findings
   and presents the possible economic gains for the farmer when using this
   information to reach a given N-loss level. Targeted measures are
   especially relevant where the subsurface N-reduction varies
   significantly within the same farm and national analyses have shown that
   a cost reduction of around 20-25\% using targeted measures is likely.
   The analyses show an increasing potential with increasing variation in
   N-reduction in the catchment. In this analysis, the knowledge of spatial
   variation in N-reduction potential is used to placemeasures like catch
   crops or set-a-side at locations with the greatest effect on 10 case
   farms in the Norsminde Catchment, Denmark. The findings suggest that the
   gains are from 0 to 32 (sic)/ha and the average farm would gain
   approximately 14-21 (sic)/ha/year from the targeted measures approach.
   The analysis indicates that the economic gain is greater than the costs
   of providing the detailed maps of 5-10 (sic)/ha/year. When N-loss
   reduction requirements are increased, the economic gains are greater.
   When combined with new measures like mini-wetlands and early sowing the
   economic advantage is increased further. The paper also shows that not
   all farms can use the detailed information on N-reduction and there is
   not a clear link between spatial variation in N-reduction at the farm
   level and possible economic gains for all these 10 farms. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This research sheds new light on the much-debated link between
   agricultural productivity and development. We do so by estimating the
   causal impact of a large shock to agricultural productivity the
   introduction of the heavy plow in the Middle Ages-on long run
   development. We build on the work of Lynn White, Jr. (1962), who argued
   that it was impossible to take proper advantage of the fertile clay
   soils of Northern Europe prior to the invention and widespread adoption
   of the heavy plow. We implement the test in a difference-in-difference
   set-up by exploiting regional variation in the presence of fertile clay
   soils. Using a high quality dataset for Denmark, we find that historical
   counties with relatively more fertile clay soil experienced higher
   urbanization after the heavy plow had its breakthrough, which was around
   AD 1000. We obtain a similar result, when we extend the test to European
   regions. Our findings substantiate that agricultural productivity can be
   an important driver of long-run development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Historical oblique aerial photographs as a powerful tool for
   communicating landscape changes}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{82-95}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports on a potential new form of data generation and data
   display to be used for communicating landscape change at local scales,
   utilizing a huge collection of oblique aerial photographs held by the
   Royal Library in Copenhagen. The collection contains local scale imagery
   covering all parts of Denmark recorded between 1930 and 1990 and thus
   has the potential to illustrate the changes which took place in the
   rural landscape as a whole after the Second World War, in ways which are
   suited for use at local scales. Taking into account that landscape
   change normally happens at a slow rate relative to the perceptive scale
   of humans, with fine grained changes taking place continuously in local
   settings, images of this kind present themselves as a way for the
   general public to become aware of changes which might otherwise be
   overlooked. To a still more urbanized population where most people do
   not have an every-day experience with rural landscape change, the images
   may be a starting point for a renewed engagement with landscapes, not
   just perceived as a scenery, but rather as a process of interaction with
   the environment. In order to inform a wider range of people, in
   competition with other types of information, the imagery provides a
   point of reference - a single farm or landscape known to the users which
   people without specific training in landscape research can relate to.
   The use of a crowdsourcing approach in data generation on a webgis
   application means that the broader public is both involved in the
   creation of the data and in the discussion about the changes observed,
   which become visible when comparing old aerial photographs to the
   present landscape. In combination with the very local nature of the
   aerial photographs, this opens up the possibility that the images could
   serve as a communicational bridge between ``abstract{''} scientific
   knowledge about landscape change (e.g. change in hedgerow density per
   year) and the local landscapes where people are living. As such, the
   approach described in this paper may contribute to the objectives set
   out in the European landscape convention to facilitate an increased
   understanding of landscape issues among the public through a democratic
   learning process. The article concludes, that this approach has a huge
   potential, although some difficulties exist, relating to the challenge
   of maintaining a focus on the landscape when using a form of
   communication which is dialogue-based and relatively unstructured
   compared to approaches embedded within conventional learning
   environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In areas where water is a major source of dietary iodine ( I), the I
   concentration in drinking water is an important factor for public health
   and epidemiological understandings. In Denmark, almost all of the
   drinking water is originating from groundwater. Therefore, understanding
   the I variation in groundwater and governing factors and processes are
   crucial. In this study, we perform uni- and multivariate analyses of all
   available historical Danish I groundwater data from 1933 to 2011 (n =
   2,562) to give an overview on the I variability for first time and to
   discover possible geochemical associations between I and twenty other
   elements and parameters. Special attention is paid on the description
   and the quality assurance of this complex compilation of historical
   data. The high variability of I in Danish groundwater (<d.l. to 1,220 mu
   g/l) is characterised by both small-scale heterogeneity and large-scale
   spatial trends, e. g. higher concentrations observed in the eastern part
   of Denmark. Significant trends are observed also with respect to the
   depth of extraction and geology, indicating the importance of older
   marine limestone and chalk deposits. A principal component analysis on
   centred log-ratio-transformed data (clr) revealed associations between
   I, Li, B, Ba, Br implying saline water influence. High I is also
   associated with reduced and alkaline groundwaters for this data set,
   dominated by Ca-HCO3 water type.}},

Abstract = {{To establish a national inventory of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks
   and their change over time, soil was sampled in 1986, 1997 and 2009 in a
   Danish nation-wide 7-km grid and analysed for SOC content. The average
   SOC stock in 0-100-cm depth soil was 142 t C ha(-1), with 63, 41 and 38
   t C ha(-1) in the 0-25, 25-50 and 50-100 cm depths, respectively.
   Changes at 0-25 cm were small. During 1986-97, SOC in the 25-50-cm layer
   increased in sandy soils while SOC decreased in loam soils. In the
   subsequent period (1997-2009), most soils showed significant losses of
   SOC. From 1986 to 2009, SOC at 0-100 cm decreased in loam soils and
   tended to increase in sandy soils. This trend is ascribed to dairy farms
   with grass leys being abundant on sandy soils while cereal cropping
   dominates on loamy soils. A statistical model including soil type, land
   use and management was applied separately to 0-25, 25-50 and 50-100 cm
   depths to pinpoint drivers for SOC change. In the 0-25 cm layer, grass
   leys added 0.95 t C ha(-1) year(-1) and autumn-sown crops with straw
   incorporation added 0.40 t C ha(-1) year(-1). Cattle manure added 0.21 t
   C ha(-1) year(-1). Most interestingly, grass leys contributed 0.58 t C
   ha(-1) year(-1) at 25-50 cm, confirming that inventories based only on
   top-soils are incomplete. We found no significant effects in 50-100 cm.
   Our study indicates a small annual loss of 0.2 t C ha(-1) from the 0-100
   cm soil layer between 1986 and 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural landscape sustainability is affected by combinations of
   agricultural developments and various forms of urbanisation. This paper
   analyses how public policy, including spatial planning, has responded
   over time and affected these two drivers which intersect in various ways
   depending on the regional context and local conditions. Using data from
   recent Danish studies, the paper shows how a large proportion of farmers
   perceive their farm more as a living place than as a production place.
   Most of these farmers are hobby farmers with an urban income who have
   moved from an urban setting to the rural landscape. As such, these hobby
   farmers represent a form of urbanisation, usually termed
   `counter-urbanisation', and they manage the landscape differently to
   full-time farmers, while they also affect demand for land and thus price
   levels. Furthermore, long-term and recent developments in public policy
   as responses to changing agricultural landscapes are analysed and
   discussed. With a focus on counter-urbanisation, the paper discusses how
   agricultural policies, environmental policies and spatial planning
   policies are poorly integrated and-when viewed together-fail to respond
   to the intersecting dynamics of agricultural developments and
   urbanisation. The paper proposes a collaborative landscape planning
   approach to ensure policy integration and to promote agricultural
   landscape sustainability.}},

   distribution in lowlands where human impacts are likely to be less
   constrained by terrain. In such regions, if important at all,
   topographic effects will depend on cultural-historical factors and thus
   be human-driven (anthropogenic) rather than natural, except in regions
   where the general climate or extreme soils limit the occurrence of
   forests. We used spatial regression modeling to assess the extent to
   which topographic factors explain forest distribution (presence-absence
   at a 48x48 m resolution) in a lowland agricultural region (Denmark,
   43,075 km(2)) at regional and landscape scales (whole study area and
   10x10 km grid cells, respectively), how landscape-scale
   forest-topography relationships vary geographically, and which potential
   drivers (topographic heterogeneity, forest cover, clay content,
   coastal/inland location) determine this geographic heterogeneity. Given
   a moist temperate climate and non-extreme soils all landscapes in
   Denmark would naturally be largely forest covered, and any topographic
   relationships will be totally or primarily human-driven. At regional
   scale, topographic predictors explained only 5\% of the distribution of
   forest. In contrast, the explanatory power of topography varied from
   0\%-61\% at landscape scale, with clear geographic patterning.
   Explanatory power of topography at landscape scale was moderately
   dependent on the potential drivers, with topographic control being
   strongest in areas with high topographic heterogeneity and little forest
   cover. However, these conditioning effects were themselves
   geographically variable. Our findings show that topography by shaping
   human land-use can affect forest distribution even in flat, lowland
   regions, but especially via localized, geographically variable effects.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate drivers behind land use changes in a
   peri-urban landscape. The research focuses on the motives and factors
   behind landowners' decision-making in relation to land use changes, with
   the objective of improving our knowledge of the dynamics of land use
   change processes on farmland. An actor-centred conceptual framework is
   developed on the basis of the concept of lenses of decision-making. Data
   on farm and farmer characteristics were collected through a survey
   conducted in Roskilde Municipality, Denmark, a peri-urban landscape with
   a high level of landscape dynamics. A logistic regression analysis was
   used to analyse the relationship between nine purposively selected farm
   and farmer characteristics and the landscape activities of 93 landowners
   in the municipality. The results indicate that small farms, farms
   without livestock and landowners with a basic level of education are
   less likely to engage in landscape activities. A cluster analysis was
   used to analyse patterns of motives associated with land use changes.
   The results correspond with the intrinsic interests and family
   considerations suggested in the lenses of the decision-making framework,
   and in addition shows that the desire to improve the qualities of the
   property was the dominant motive.}},

Abstract = {{A 133 yr data set from the 1055 km(2) Skjern River catchment in western
   Denmark has been analysed with respect to precipitation, temperature,
   evapotranspiration and discharge. The precipitation series have been
   tested and corrected using the standard normal homogeneity test and
   subsequently corrected for undercatch. The degree of change in the
   climatic variables is examined using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   test. During the last 133 yr the area has experienced a significant
   change in precipitation of 26\% and a temperature change of 1.4 degrees
   C, leading to increases in river discharge of 52\% and groundwater
   recharge of 86 \%. A lumped conceptual hydrological model, NAM, was
   calibrated on the period 1951-1980 and showed generally an excellent
   match between simulated and observed discharge. The capability of the
   hydrological model to predict climate change impact was investigated by
   looking at performances outside the calibration period. The results
   showed a reduced model fit, especially for recent time periods (after
   the 1980s), and not all hydrological changes could be explained. This
   might indicate that hydrological models cannot be expected to predict
   climate change impacts on discharge as accurately in the future,
   compared to the performance under present conditions, where they can be
   calibrated. The (simulated) stream discharge was subsequently analysed
   using high flow and drought indices based on the threshold method. The
   extreme signal was found to depend highly on the period chosen as
   reference to normal. The analysis indicated that no significant
   amplitude increase of the hydrograph for both wet and dry extremes could
   be found superimposed on the overall discharge increase.}},

Abstract = {{The grazing of semi-natural grassland (SNG) is encouraged in Europe for
   the conservation of biodiversity, but little is known about the farming

   was to explore and evaluate at farm level the (1) technical results in
   terms of animal growth, feed use and carcass quality, (2) landscape
   biodiversity value, based on case study of ten Danish suckler beef farms
   with data recording over one year. Herd size varied from 5 to 213
   suckler cows. The main conclusion was that an increasing proportion of
   SNG (up to 45\% of net energy in a year diet at herd level) did not
   obviously imply low technical performances. However, when SNG was used
   as the entire feed to all animals all year long (over 80\% of net energy
   in a year diet at herd level), performances were lower and meat quality
   did not fit the requirements of the meat industry, but were considered
   in alternative market chains. This last type of management (rustic
   breeds kept permanently on SNG) had the highest use of grassland (one
   suckler cow and her offspring for roughly every 3 ha SNG) and thus the
   highest biodiversity conservation potential. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Buffers for biomass production in temperate European agriculture: A
   review and synthesis on function, ecosystem services and implementation}},
Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{53-67}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Buffer strips on agricultural land have been shown to protect surface
   water quality by reducing erosion and diffuse pollution. They can also
   play a key role in nature conservation and flood risk mitigation as well
   as in the design of bioenergy landscapes resilient to changes in
   climate, environmental pressures from intensive agriculture and policy
   developments. Use of conservation buffers by farmers outside of
   designated schemes is limited to date, but the increasing demand for
   bioenergy and the combination of agricultural production with
   conservation calls for a much wider implementation.
   This paper reviews the biophysical knowledge on buffer functioning and
   associated ecosystem services. It describes how a three-zone buffer
   design, with arable fields buffered in combination by grassland, short
   rotation forestry (SRF) or coppice (SRC) and undisturbed vegetation
   along water courses, can be incorporated into farming landscapes as
   productive conservation elements and reflects on the potential for
   successful implementation.
   Land use plays a much greater role in determining catchment hydrology
   than soil type: shelterbelts or buffer strips have markedly higher
   infiltration capacity than arable or pasture land. Root architecture of
   trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants differs between species and is
   important for the extent of hydrological changes after establishment.
   Riparian buffers retain 30-99\% of nitrate N and 20-100\% of phosphorus
   from runoff and shallow groundwater. Buffers are also highly effective
   for pesticide removal and farmland biodiversity conservation with a high
   potential for low-input fuel, feed, or fibre production. Landscape
   amenities, sporting opportunities, and a display of land stewardship are
   additional benefits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantitative vegetation reconstruction from pollen analysis and

Abstract = {{Questions Can the model performance of the landscape reconstruction
   algorithm (LRA) for small forest hollows be validated through comparison
   to inventory-based vegetation reconstructions from the last 150yrs? Does
   the application of LRA and the comparison to historical data enhance
   interpretation of the pollen record? Location Denmark. The
   Gribskov-Ostrup small forest hollow (56 degrees N, 12 degrees 20E, 44m
   a.s.l.) in the forest of Gribskov, eastern Denmark. Methods Pollen
   analysis was carried out on a small forest hollow, and LRA used to
   derive pollen-based quantitative estimates of past vegetation.
   Historical forest inventory data and maps were used to reconstruct the
   vegetation within three different circles around the hollow (20, 50 and
   200m ring widths) for five time periods during the last 150yrs. The
   results of the two approaches were compared in order to evaluate model
   performance, and the LRA-based reconstruction used to describe how the
   model changes interpretation of vegetation development during the last
   ca. 6500yrs compared to the use of pollen percentages alone. Results
   Distance-weighted inventory-based reconstructions within 200m of the
   hollow's edge provide the best match with the LRA-modelled vegetation.
   Precise validation of the model is not possible due to insufficient
   historical data, but the comparison indicates that the LRA
   reconstruction for Gribskov tends to (1) underestimate tree cover and
   overestimate open areas, (2) give a too high representation of on-site
   pollen types, (3) give an underestimation of Fagus and (4) a small
   overestimation of Quercus and Corylus. Despite these uncertainties,
   application of the LRA model shows a higher degree of openness than
   would be apparent from the uncorrected pollen diagram, and makes it
   possible to attempt to distinguish changes at the local scale from
   regional vegetation changes, thus giving a clearer picture of the
   vegetation changes at the site. Conclusions We demonstrate that the
   estimates of the LRA model applied to pollen data from small forest
   hollows can be compared with small-scale historical data to evaluate
   model performance.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the paper is to demonstrate a methodology to establish
   data for analysing the geographical patterns in the economic performance

   register data on physical activity levels with sample-based farm
   economic accounts data. Using a least-squares approach, the method
   estimates economic figures for each farm in the population conditional
   on farm size, land allocation and number of different types of
   livestock. The method is used for describing the spatial patterns in
   economic returns to agriculture, using Denmark as an illustrative
   example. Economic contribution/hectare is relatively stronger in western
   parts of the country. This is associated with high livestock density in
   these areas, but the high livestock density also poses future economic
   challenges to farms in these areas to a higher extent than in the rest
   of Denmark.}},

Abstract = {{In the endeavor of optimizing the sustainability of bioenergy production
   in Denmark, this consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluated the
   environmental impacts associated with the production of heat and
   electricity from one hectare of Danish arable land cultivated with three
   perennial crops: ryegrass (Lolium perenne), willow (Salix viminalis) and
   Miscanthus giganteus. For each, four conversion pathways were assessed
   against a fossil fuel reference: (I) anaerobic co-digestion with manure,
   (II) gasification, (III) combustion in small-to-medium scale biomass
   combined heat and power (CHP) plants and IV) co-firing in large scale
   coal-fired CHP plants. Soil carbon changes, direct and indirect land use
   changes as well as uncertainty analysis (sensitivity, MonteCarlo) were
   included in the LCA. Results showed that global warming was the
   bottleneck impact, where only two scenarios, namely willow and
   Miscanthus co-firing, allowed for an improvement as compared with the
   reference (-82 and -45 t CO2-eq. ha(-1), respectively). The indirect
   land use changes impact was quantified as 310 + 170 t CO2-eq. ha(-1),
   representing a paramount average of 41\% of the induced greenhouse gas
   emissions. The uncertainty analysis confirmed the results robustness and
   highlighted the indirect land use changes uncertainty as the only
   uncertainty that can significantly change the outcome of the LCA
   results.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study we assess the economic profitability of implementing
   various precision farming (PF) technologies and controlled traffic
   farming (CTF) on 4 main crops in Denmark. The study provides insight
   into technological requirements, and identifies related costs and
   benefits to farmers and the Danish society as a whole. At the farm
   level, the findings from the study indicate that an implementation of
   CTF systems may have a significant impact on fuel savings due to a
   reduced overlap with auto guidance systems and easier movement with
   tractors and tools in the field. The PF site-specific weed management
   approach may facilitate large savings in the use of herbicides. At the
   national level, the results clearly show that the benefits to the Danish
   economy of adopting this new technology is positive with increased
   income to farmers and a reduction in fuel consumption and
   pesticides/herbicides use. The obtained results reflect the long term
   economic effect of implementing new production methods in Denmark where
   soil fertility increases over time due to reduced traffic increasing
   yields. Over all, the Danish GDP is estimated to increase by 34 million
   a,not sign due to the implementation of PF and CTF on larger farms in
   Denmark. The results also clearly show that adoption of PF and CTF
   farming systems will benefit the environment. The agricultural sectors
   input of environmental harmful inputs are reduced in all scenarios
   presented in this paper. The adoption of PF and CTF systems should thus
   be of interest to politicians since it clearly facilitates aims of
   environmental policies currently under implementation by the Danish
   government.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the conversion of Danish agricultural land from
   food/feed crops to energy crops. To this end, a life cycle inventory,
   which relates the input and output flows from and to the environment of
   528 different crop systems, is built and described. This includes seven
   crops (annuals and perennials), two soil types (sandy loam and sand),
   two climate types (wet and dry), three initial soil carbon level (high,
   average, low), two time horizons for soil carbon changes (20 and 100
   years), two residues management practices (removal and incorporation
   into soil) as well as three soil carbon turnover rate reductions in
   response to the absence of tillage for some perennial crops (0\%, 25\%,
   50\%). For all crop systems, nutrient balances, balances between above-
   and below-ground residues, soil carbon changes, biogenic carbon dioxide
   flows, emissions of nitrogen compounds and losses of macro- and
   micronutrients are presented. The inventory results highlight Miscanthus
   as a promising energy crop, indicating it presents the lowest emissions
   of nitrogen compounds, the highest amount of carbon dioxide sequestrated
   from the atmosphere, a relatively high carbon turnover efficiency and
   allows to increase soil organic carbon. Results also show that the
   magnitude of these benefits depends on the harvest season, soil types
   and climatic conditions. Inventory results further highlight winter
   wheat as the only annual crop where straw removal for bioenergy may be
   sustainable, being the only annual crop not involving losses of soil
   organic carbon as a result of harvesting the straw. This, however, is
   conditional to manure application, and is only true on sandy soils.}},

Abstract = {{Economic modelling generally assumes that businesses are profit
   maximisers. However, behavioural economics holds that businesses pursue
   multiple objectives and may even sacrifice some profit. This has
   implications for the effectiveness of incentive-based environmental
   policies. Using Danish farmers as a case, this paper examines whether
   non-economic rationales may trump economic ones in farmer decisions,
   and, unlike previous research, we quantify how widespread non-economic
   values are compared to more economic values. Data derive from a survey
   (1164 responses) of Danish conventional farmers' decision rationales
   regarding their use of pesticides. Using cluster analysis, we show that
   some farmers are more economically motivated while other farmers are
   more focused on optimising yield and pay less attention to expenditures
   and crop prices. Furthermore, we find that the two groups differ in
   their response to policy instruments; farmers who focus on yield
   indicate less responsiveness to economic policy instruments. The results
   imply that it is important to implement a broad array of policy
   instruments to match different farmer rationales.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of generic methods to assess the environmental consequences of
   agricultural practices and the lack of consensus on monitoring and
   evaluation of environmental, agricultural and socio-economic effects of
   agri-environment schemes (AES) in EU Member States call for better
   evaluation methods. The `Agri-environmental Footprint' project proposed
   to deal with these problems by establishing a new evaluation method, the
   Agri-Environmental Footprint Index (AFI). The AFI is an index customised
   to local stakeholder preferences, using expert knowledge for assessment
   of impacts and sensitivity, and indicators of the environmental state at
   farm level. In a Danish test case, agricultural practices at twenty-five
   farms in two groundwater protection zones were assessed. Data was
   collected from databases, registers, maps and interviews with farmers.
   The index was calculated for 1996/7 and 2006/7 to track temporal
   development and effects of entering an agri-environmental scheme. The
   Danish case demonstrated that the index can be used to track changes in
   environmental impacts and that entering agri-environmental scheme had a
   positive impact on the index value. However, the index should be used
   with caution. It is important to consider the robustness of each
   indicator: to assess whether changes will occur over time; whether
   changes are linked to management practices or external factors; and
   whether data are available up to date. Indicators dependent upon uptake
   data from agri-environmental schemes should be used with great caution.
   Retrospective use of stakeholder preferences is subject to uncertainty
   because preferences may have changed over time.}},

Abstract = {{Farming transformed societies globally. Yet, despite more than a century
   of research, there is little consensus on the speed or completeness of
   this fundamental change and, consequently, on its principal drivers. For
   Northern Europe, the debate has often centered on the rich
   archaeological record of the Western Baltic, but even here it is unclear
   how quickly or completely people abandoned wild terrestrial and marine
   resources after the introduction of domesticated plants and animals at
   similar to 4000 calibrated years B.C. Ceramic containers are found
   ubiquitously on these sites and contain remarkably well-preserved lipids
   derived from the original use of the vessel. Reconstructing culinary
   practices from this ceramic record can contribute to longstanding
   debates concerning the origins of farming. Here we present data on the
   molecular and isotopic characteristics of lipids extracted from 133
   ceramic vessels and 100 carbonized surface residues dating to
   immediately before and after the first evidence of domesticated animals
   and plants in the Western Baltic. The presence of specific lipid
   biomarkers, notably omega-(o-alkylphenyl) alkanoic acids, and the
   isotopic composition of individual n-alkanoic acids clearly show that a
   significant proportion (similar to 20\%) of ceramic vessels with lipids
   preserved continued to be used for processing marine and freshwater
   resources across the transition to agriculture in this region. Although
   changes in pottery use are immediately evident, our data challenge the
   popular notions that economies were completely transformed with the
   arrival of farming and that Neolithic pottery was exclusively associated
   with produce from domesticated animals and plants.}},

Abstract = {{Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture are a significant
   contributor to total Danish emissions. Consequently, much effort is
   currently given to the exploration of potential strategies to reduce
   agricultural emissions. This paper presents results from a study
   estimating agricultural GHG emissions in the form of methane, nitrous
   oxide and carbon dioxide (including carbon sources and sinks, and the
   impact of energy consumption/bioenergy production) from Danish
   agriculture in the years 1990-2010. An analysis of possible measures to
   reduce the GHG emissions indicated that a 50-70\% reduction of
   agricultural emissions by 2050 relative to 1990 is achievable, including
   mitigation measures in relation to the handling of manure and
   fertilisers, optimization of animal feeding, cropping practices, and
   land use changes with more organic farming, afforestation and energy
   crops. In addition, the bioenergy production may be increased
   significantly without reducing the food production, whereby Danish
   agriculture could achieve a positive energy balance. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Danish farmers have been far less interested in agri-environmental
   subsidy schemes (AES) than anticipated. In order to examine how to
   improve the appeal of such schemes, a choice experiment was conducted
   concerning 444 Danish farmers' preferences for subsidy schemes for
   pesticide-free buffer zones. A random parameter logit framework was used
   to capture heterogeneity among farmers. Our results indicate that 1) the
   vast majority of farmers are willing to trade off the size of the
   subsidy for less restrictive scheme requirements and that 2) the amount
   of the subsidy they are willing to trade off varies with specific scheme
   requirements, suggesting which features are most important for
   successful policy design. Our results suggest that farmers value
   flexible contract terms higher than reduced administrative burdens.
   Finally, we suggest a practical approach to estimating a monetary value
   of farmers' reluctance to participate in AES. While the trade off's that
   farmers are willing to make between subsidy size and individual scheme
   requirements are case specific, our results concerning increased use of
   farm advisors, farmers ability of valuing different types of
   flexibility, and our attempt to place a monetary value on farmers'
   reluctance to engage in regulatory subsidy schemes have a potentially
   broader application platform. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{281-291}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the structure of agriculture are known to affect emissions of
   environmental pollutants from agriculture. Such changes are often driven
   by structural changes in agricultural production, so structural changes
   are likely to have indirect effects on emissions. In a pilot study, we
   consider how linking two complementary simulation models might be used
   to explore these effects. The agent-based AgriPoliS model was used to
   simulate the structural dynamics of agricultural production. The results
   from AgriPoliS were passed via a number of intermediate models to the
   Farm-N model, which was used to estimate the nitrogen surplus and losses
   from each farm for each year.
   The modelling complex was exercised by simulating the effects of two
   plausible policy scenarios for each of 14 years. The initial sizes and
   types of farms were based on statistics from a region in Denmark and the
   farms were randomly distributed within this region. The reference
   scenario (REF) implemented the current area-based Common Agricultural
   Policy payments for Denmark. The 1 LU scenario applied the additional
   constraint that a minimum area of 1 ha land had to be available for the
   application of the manure produced by one livestock unit.
   Substantial changes in the structure of agricultural production were
   shown for both scenarios. The effect on the regional nitrogen surpluses
   was predicted to differ between scenarios and the contribution of the
   different farm types to change with time. Predicted ammonia emission
   changed with time and differed between the scenarios, whereas the Danish
   fertiliser and manure legislation meant that nitrate leaching remained
   fairly stable.
   The implementation of additional environmental legislation significantly
   changed the trajectory of structural adjustment processes. Results
   emphasize the complex interplay between structural changes, losses of
   nitrogen, and environmental regulation.
   It is concluded that the effects of structural change on environmental
   emissions can be usefully explored by linking agent-based models of
   farmers' investment decisions with other models describing nutrient
   losses from the farm and that such modelling can play a useful role in
   designing effective environmental policies for agriculture. However, the
   approach demands the availability or collection of many region-specific
   data and this could create a barrier to its use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{Rural landscapes are mainly maintained and changed through farmers'
   decisions and practices. As a landscape manager the farmer has many
   different roles of which three roles related to the farm as a whole is
   investigated in this paper: producer, owner and citizen. Although most
   farmers take landscape decisions in all these three roles production
   based decisions are assumed to be more important for full time farmers
   than for hobby farmers who have their main income outside the farm and
   who may consider their farm more as a living place than as a production
   place. Based on a large survey carried out in Hvorslev, Eastern Jutland,
   Denmark in 2008 farmers' landscape practices are analysed in relation to
   their background, occupational status and view of their farms as a
   production place versus a living place. Altogether 377 farmers were
   interviewed and some comparisons are made to a similar survey in the
   same area in 1996. It was found that a significant proportion of farmers
   are hobby farmers who mainly see the farm as a living place and who to a
   large degree have different landscape practices than full time farmers
   have. The findings indicate that more research is needed to fully
   understand the reasons for and implications of the differences in
   landscape management practices.}},

Volume = {{111}},

Pages = {{59-72}},
Abstract = {{Peri-urbanisation, as a process of the physical expansion of settlement
   areas but also socio-economic transformation, has been recognised as a
   major spatial development beyond the urban fringes. Agriculture, the
   main land use actor in the hinterlands of many urban areas is
   increasingly affected by urban encroachment, responds with adaptation
   strategies and farming activities to cope with the peri-urban framework
   conditions. Adaptation pathways encompass specialisation into
   horticulture as well as enhanced environmental and lifestyle orientation
   of farming - typical elements of multifunctional agriculture. However,
   due to the heterogeneity of the peri-urbanisation processes also
   differences in farming transition are expected. Based on a
   differentiation into displaced-urbanisation, ex-urbanisation,
   anti-urbanisation and hidden-urbanisation as main types of
   peri-urbanisation, variances of farming responses are elaborated for
   municipal entities in the Copenhagen region in Denmark using statistical

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an analysis that predicts the scale
   efficiency of individual farms and analyses the differences in scale
   efficiency over time and between farms. Representative farm account data
   for 1985-2006 are used, and the study applies stochastic frontier
   analysis using an input distance-function approach. The results show
   that pig farms have improved their input scale efficiency significantly
   over time, as have dairy farms during the last few years after a period
   of constant scale efficiency. Crop farms have the lowest scale
   efficiency, and there is a considerable potential for improving
   productivity in the cash crop sector by increasing the size of the
   farms. It is shown that a change in scale efficiency and technological
   change are the major components of aggregate productivity changes for
   all farm types.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional cropping systems rely on targeted short-term fertility
   management, whereas organic systems depend, in part, on long-term
   increase in soil fertility as determined by crop rotation and
   management. Such differences influence soil nitrogen (N) cycling and
   availability through the year. The main objective of this study was to
   compare nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil under winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L) within three organic and one conventional cropping
   system that differed in type of fertilizer, presence of catch crops and
   proportion of N-2-fixing crops. The study was replicated in two
   identical long-term crop rotation experiments on sandy loam soils under
   different climatic conditions in Denmark (Flakkebjerg eastern Denmark
   and Foulum western Denmark). The conventional rotation received 165-170
   kg N ha(-1) in the form of NH4NO3, while the organic rotations received
   100-110 kg N ha(-1) as pig slurry. For at least 11 months, as from
   September 2007, static chambers were used to measure N2O emissions at
   least twice every calendar month. Mean daily N2O emissions across the
   year ranged from 172 to 438 mu g N m(-2) d(-1) at Flakkebjerg, and from
   173 to 250 mu g N m(-2) d(-1) at Foulum. A multiple linear regression
   analysis showed inter-seasonal variations in emissions (P < 0.001), but
   annual N2O emissions from organic and conventional systems were not
   significantly different despite the lower N input in organic rotations.
   The annual emissions ranged from 54 to 137 mg N m(-2), which
   corresponded to 0.5-0.8\% of the N applied in manure or mineral
   fertilizer. Selected soil attributes were monitored to support the
   interpretation of N2O emission patterns. A second multiple linear
   regression analysis with potential drivers of N2O emissions showed a
   negative response to soil temperature (P = 0.008) and percent
   water-filled pore space (WFPS) (P = 0.052) at Foulum. However, there
   were positive interactions of both factors with NO3-N, i.e., high N2O
   emissions occurred during periods when high soil nitrate levels
   coincided with high soil temperature (P = 0.016) or high soil water
   content (P = 0.056). A positive effect (P = 0.03) of soil temperature
   was identified at Flakkebjerg, but the number of soil samplings was
   limited. Effects of cropping system on N2O emissions were not observed.

Abstract = {{The subject of this paper is the views of farmers concerning their local
   landscape. In two contrasting Danish case study areas previously
   analysed in the 1990s, a small number of farmers have been interviewed
   regarding their views of the landscape and recent changes in their
   respective area including landscape changes. One of the areas (Hvorslev)
   is characterized by good conditions for agriculture, intensive husbandry
   production and a relatively stable landscape history. The other (Nees)
   has more marginal conditions and major changes in land use characterize
   the recent landscape history. We analyze the way in which the landscape
   is perceived by farmers and compare their views of the changing
   landscapes with the actual recorded changes on the one hand, and with
   other significant changes on the other. Farmers in both areas emphasized
   the same type of structural changes in agriculture and in the villages
   as significant, whereas only farmers in Nees indicated that the
   landscape had changed. When asked to characterize the landscape, farmers
   in Nees replied with a greater degree of detail and were more locally
   focused compared to farmers in Hvorslev who mainly referred to (well
   known) sites located a few kilometres outside the area in question.
   Long-term experiences with landscape changes and collective actions
   concerning landscape issues are suggested as the main reasons that
   farmers in Nees share a well developed awareness of their local
   landscape. We conclude by discussing some implications of this study for
   landscape research and policy.}},

Abstract = {{Historical data on organic waste and wastewater treatment during the
   period of 1970-2020 were used to assess the impact of treatment on
   energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances. The assessment included the
   waste fractions: Sewage sludge, food waste, yard waste and other organic
   waste (paper, plastic, etc.). Data were collected from Aalborg, a
   municipality located in Northern Denmark. During the period from
   1970-2005, Aalborg Municipality has changed its waste treatment strategy
   from landfilling of all wastes toward composting of yard waste and
   incineration with combined heat and power production from the remaining
   organic municipal waste. Wastewater treatment has changed from direct
   discharge of untreated wastewater to full organic matter and nutrient
   (N, P) removal combined with anaerobic digestion of the sludge for
   biogas production with power and heat generation. These changes in
   treatment technology have resulted in the waste and wastewater treatment
   systems in Aalborg progressing from being net consumers of energy and
   net emitters of GHG, to becoming net producers of energy and net savers
   of GHG emissions (due to substitution of fossil fuels elsewhere). If it
   is assumed that the organic waste quantity and composition is the same
   in 1970 and 2005, the technology change over this time period has
   resulted in a progression from a net annual GHG emission of 200 kg
   CO2-eq. capita(-1) in 1970 to a net saving of 170 kg CO2-eq. capita(-1)
   in 2005 for management of urban organic wastes.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of spatial variation in multi-species weed communities together
   with environmental factors may be useful as a tool for developing
   sustainable long-term weed control and to better understand the ecology
   of weed species. We present an analysis of species recorded in 491
   Danish fields surveyed in 2001-2004 distributed in 11 common
   agricultural crops. By using cluster analysis and canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) we identify crops that resemble each other
   with respect to their associated flora. By CCA, correlation and
   regression analyses we illustrate how the incidences of 40 common
   species relate to each other and can be related to important soil
   factors measured in the uppermost 20 cm. Clay content, pH, phosphorous,
   exchangeable potassium and magnesium, total nitrogen and carbon content
   in the soil were estimated.
   Based on weed frequency the cluster analysis separates the perennial
   crop (grass leys) from the annual crops (largest distance) and further,
   winter from summer annual crops. The cluster and correlation analyses
   reveal which plants usually occur together. The regression analyses
   showed that P and clay were the most important of the measured factors
   affecting the occurrence of the species and indicated the importance of
   the different soil factors for the occurrence of each of the 40 species.
   This study highlights how crop type and some important growing
   conditions affect the weed communities in Danish fields. Identification
   of key factors for the distribution of weed species may be used to
   improve weed control but may also be valuable for understanding weed
   communities and for creating a higher biodiversity in arable land. (C)

Abstract = {{The organic movement has its roots in a critical attitude towards the
   capitalist development of farming and food systems and constitutes in
   that sense an alternative to conventional food systems. The article aims
   at exploring which meaning the notions of `alternative' and
   `conventional' carry, using the historical development of organic food
   in Denmark as an example. From the 1970s and onwards, organic food
   networks in Denmark have evolved from being primarily a marginal social
   movement to becoming included in the market mainstream. The social and
   spatial settings for organic food networks in Denmark have thus been
   significantly altered. Using debates on the conventionalisation of
   organic food systems as the starting point, it is argued in this article
   that this development in Denmark can be interpreted from a relational
   perspective as an ongoing process of establishing organisational
   innovations, which transcends established dichotomies between notions
   like alternative and mainstream.}},

Title = {{Long-term productivity and environmental effects of arable farming as
   affected by crop rotation, soil tillage intensity and strategy of
   pesticide use: A case-study of two long-term field experiments in

Abstract = {{On the basis of one 12-year lasting experiment in Germany and one 4-year
   lasting experiment in Denmark, different crop rotations, soil tillage
   intensities, and strategies of pesticide use were investigated with
   regard to yield, humus replacement, nitrogen (N) balance, energy use
   efficiency as well as acute and chronic risk potentials for aquatic and
   terrestrial organisms clue to pesticide application. The investigation
   of the Danish experiment concerned two crop rotations (Continuous winter
   wheat cropping, `FR 1': winter oilseed rape-winter wheat-winter
   wheat-winter barley,'FR 2'), three intensities of soil tillage
   (ploughing, `P': tine tillage `H8-10'; direct drilling, `D') and three
   target control levels against Apera spica-venti (untreated, `AU': 70\%
   control, `A 70\%'; and 90\% control, `A 90\%'), whilst the German
   experiment comprised one arable crop rotation (winter oilseed
   rape-winter wheat-winter rye-peas-winter wheat-winter-barley, `DR 1')and
   one fodder crop rotation (winter oilseed rape-winter
   barley-alfalfa/clover/grass-mixture-winter rye-silage maize-winter
   wheat,'DR 2') each crop with situation-related pesticide use (100\% HF)
   or application rates reduced by 50\% (50\% HF). At both sites, rotations
   and treatments were located on the same plots in each year. The Study
   comprises the harvest years 2003-2006.
   Humus requirement could be covered in all crop rotations, while humus
   replacement rate was highest in `FR 1'. Total yield potential of the
   crop rotations was expressed by grain equivalent (GE) yields and energy
   output. The different crop rotations influenced yield potential to a
   larger extent than pesticide use intensity or tillage. The average GE
   yields and energy Outputs of `FR 1' (83.5 GE ha(-1) : 121.7 GJ ha(-1))
   were significantly higher compared with `FR 2' (64.2 GE ha(-1); 93.2 GJ
   ha(-1)); `DR 2'(72.9 GE ha(-1); 192.3 GJ ha (1)) exceeded `DR 1'(70.0 GE
   ha(-1): 100.3 GJ ha(-1)). Higher N Surpluses were found for the Danish
   crop rotations than for the German experiment, probably due to the
   relatively low N use efficiency of pig Slurry, which was applied to each
   crop in `FR 1' and `FR 2'. Averaged across all treatments, N surplus for
   `FR 1', FR 2', `DR V, and `DR 2' were 72.9, 94.4, 32.0, and 38.2 kg N
   ha(-1), respectively. Similar to yield, energy efficiency at both sites
   was noteworthy affected by crop rotation and minor by pesticide use
   intensity or tillage. The risk potential due to pesticide application
   was low in all treatments. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wind farms are positioned in open landscapes and may cause loss of
   wildlife habitat due to disturbance, fragmentation, and infrastructure
   development. Especially flocking geese, swans, ducks and waders are
   regarded as vulnerable to wind farm development. We compared past and
   current displacement effects of two onshore wind farms and a line of
   land-based turbines on spring-staging pink-footed geese (Anser
   brachyrhynchus) to see if there was evidence of habituation. In one wind
   farm area, geese previously (1998) (Larsen and Madsen 2000) kept a
   distance of c. 200 m (the distance at which 50\% of peak densities is
   reached) and they did not go between the turbines; today (2008) they
   keep a distance of c. 100 m, but do still not enter the wind farm area.
   In another wind farm, where foraging geese previously (2000) kept a
   distance of more than 100 m and did not enter the wind farm, they now
   (2008) forage between the wind turbines and keep a distance of c. 40 m
   to turbines. In 1998, geese kept a distance of 125 m to a line of
   turbines, compared to 50 m now. We conclude that geese have behaviorally
   adapted to changing landscapes created by wind farms. The difference in
   avoidance between the sites may be due to the sizes of the turbines
   which in this study were small in both rotor-swept area and in height
   compared to more recent ``industry standard{''} of 2.5 and 3.0 MW
   turbines. The study points to the need for longer term studies to
   properly assess the impact of wind farms on wildlife, including
   consequent increased risks from inclement weather events of feeding,
   rafting, and migrating waterfowl.}},

Volume = {{128}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The environmental consequences of changing from conventional to reduced
   soil tillage in winter crops are yet poorly understood under North
   European conditions. Soil tillage intensity may affect both crop growth
   and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) turnover and balances, including
   emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO(2) and N(2)O. In this
   study we compared the effects of conventional tillage (CT) using
   mouldboard ploughing to 20 cm depth, reduced tillage (RT) using rotary
   harrowing to 8-10 cm depth and direct drilling (DD) with disk coulters
   on fluxes of CO(2) and N(2)O from loamy sand soil under winter oilseed
   rape (Brassica napus L) followed by winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).
   The measurements were conducted by use of chambers over a period from
   August 2003 to July 2005 in a soil tillage experiment established in
   Denmark in 2002. To integrate information on the C and GHG budgets for
   the experiment, the FASSET model was used with no recalibration in a
   two-step modelling procedure. First, we fitted the soil organic matter
   (SOM) model of FASSET to give the observed ratio of soil CO(2)
   respiration from the CT and DD treatments by scaling all decomposition
   and maintenance parameters for the DD treatment with the same value
   (delta), called the ``tillage factor{''}. Second, the complete FASSET
   model was run with default parameter value for ploughing depth in CT
   (delta = 1.00) and the estimated value for DD (delta = 0.57), in order
   to quantify the cumulated CO(2) and N(2)O emissions. Both measurements
   and model simulations showed that the combined global warming potential
   (GWP) from CO(2) and N(2)O emissions was lower from reduced tillage
   treatments (RT and DD) than from conventional tillage. Thus, compared
   with CT, modelled reduced soil tillage treatments decreased GHG
   emissions by 0.56 (RT) and 1.84 (DD) Mg CO(2-) eq. ha(-1) year(-1).
   Similar differences between treatments were obtained for simulations
   over 30 years of observed weather for the specific site. In both cases,
   negative GWPs for the studied site were obtained. A sensitivity analysis
   showed that the simulated GHG emissions were primarily influenced by
   changes in SOM model parameters, whereas observed changes in soil water
   retention affected only N(2)O emissions, and soil temperature had only
   minor effects. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{European agricultural systems are going through a modernisation process
   involving radical structural changes. To tackle these important
   challenges, technology foresight has been employed as a systematic,
   participatory, intelligence gathering exercise focusing on future R\&D
   investments in sustainable agricultural systems and green technologies.
   Because reliable data on emerging technology are scarce, any assessment
   has to be based to a large extent on qualitative methods and on an
   operational conception of sustainability using priority indicators. The
   paper describes the Danish Green Technological Foresight on
   Environmental Friendly Agriculture (GTFEFA). It treats this as a case
   study and examines the way in which a group of interested parties
   arrived at recommendations on the application of a number of emerging
   agriculture-related technologies. Two questions are then addressed: Can
   technological foresight simultaneously: (1) systematically describe and
   evaluate the consequences of employing emerging technologies in order to
   choose between alternatives, and (2) prioritise investments in emerging
   technologies so as to favour innovation. The discussion here is intended
   to help meet the challenge of operationalising the term
   `sustainability', so that environmental friendly agricultural technology
   can be assessed against priority indicators. Finally, it is suggested
   that, provided that clear criteria for assessing the sustainability of
   emerging technologies are identified and made explicit, technology
   foresight offers a space for dialogue and exploration in contested
   territory. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A farm-gate nutrient balance showed that the surpluses per hectare fell
   from 175 to 123 kg N, from 29 to 13 kg P and from 61 to 32 kg K from
   1979/80 to 2003/04. Consequently, the nutrient use efficiency (total
   output in \% of total input) increased for N from 20\% in 1979/80 to
   37\% in 2003/04, for P from 23\% to 52\% and for K from 18\% to 43\%.
   Parallel to the peak in surplus of N around 1980, elevated nitrogen
   concentrations were observed in ground and marine waters. A series of
   agro-environmental action plans were initiated, and the discharge of N
   to Danish coastal waters was reduced, though less than the reduction in
   surplus and losses from agriculture. In contrast to N, the reduction in
   P surplus was not reflected in any reduction in discharge of P from
   agriculture during the last two decades. A farm-gate account of N
   surplus is a reasonable indicator of potential N loss, whereas loss of P
   is mainly related to the soil P saturation level and to specific loss
   events. By preparing accounts for sub-sectors such as the arable and
   animal production sectors or for products within these sectors,
   farm-gate nutrient balances show the development in agricultural
   production, in addition to the trend in potential environmental impacts.
   Nutrient balances may thus link the environmental aspect to the economic
   aspect of agricultural production and assist in the monitoring of the
   sustainability of agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an investigation of relationships between organic
   farming and landscape composition in Denmark. Landscape composition was
   analysed in terms of density of uncultivated landscape elements (I),
   number of land uses per hectare (II), diversity of land use (III) and
   mean field size (IV). Two analytical approaches were used. The first was
   based on an examination of the national agricultural registers for 1998,
   2001 and 2004. The second approach used aerial photo interpretation for
   an analysis of 72 conventional and 40 organic farms within three sample
   areas for 1982, 1995 and 2002. The national analysis indicated that
   organic farming has a direct effect on landscape composition. In 2001,
   organic farms were characterised by a higher number of land uses per ha,
   a higher land use diversity and smaller mean field sizes. From 1998 to
   2004, conversion to organic farming was related to an increasing number
   of land uses per ha, increasing land-use diversity and decreasing mean
   field sizes. Relationships between organic farming and landscape
   composition were independent of variations in regional location, farm
   size or farm size change. At the level of sample areas, a significant
   relationship between organic farming and landscape composition was only
   found for densities of small biotopes. However, when differences in farm
   size and physical geographical conditions between conventional and
   organic farms were taken into account, several significant differences
   in landscape composition were clarified in two of the three sample
   areas. Furthermore, changes in landscape composition following
   conversion to organic farming were largely biased by the characteristics
   of the sample areas. Thus, in contrast to the national level, the sample
   area study indicated that differences in landscape composition between
   organic and conventional farms were not a direct implication of organic
   farming practices, but were related to variations within other
   parameters and to the location of organically farmed land. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{There is a need for valid and representative data on the production,
   resource use and emissions from different farm types in Denmark for
   public regulation and assessment. The data should be usable for both
   area-based environmental assessment (e.,,. nitrate leaching per ha) and
   product-oriented environmental assessment (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions
   per kg pork). The objective of this study was to establish a national
   agricultural model for estimating data on resource use, production and
   environmentally important emissions for a set of representative farm
   types. Every year a sample of farm accounts is established in order to
   report Danish agro-economical data to the `Farm Accountancy Data
   Network' (FADN), and to produce `The annual Danish account statistics
   for agriculture'. The farm accounts are selected and weighted to be
   representative for the Danish agricultural sector, and similar samples
   of farm accounts are collected in most of the European countries. Based
   on a sample of 2138 farm accounts from year 1999 a national agricultural
   model, consisting of 3 1 farm types. was constructed. The farm accounts
   were grouped according to the major soil types, the number of working
   hours, the most important enterprise (dairy, pig, different cash crops),
   livestock density, etc. For each group the farm account data on the
   average resource use, products sold, land use and herd structure were
   used to establish a farm type with coherency between livestock
   production, feed use, land use, yields. imported feed, homegrown feed,
   manure production, fertilizer use and crop production. The set of farm
   types was scaled up to national level thus representing the whole Danish
   agricultural sector and the resulting production, resource use and land
   use was checked against the national statistics. Nutrient balance
   methodology and state-of-the-art emission models and factors were used
   to establish the emissions of nitrate, phosphate, ammonia, nitrous
   oxide, methane and fossil carbon dioxide from each farm type. In this
   paper data oil resource uses and emissions from selected farm types are
   presented and it is demonstrated that this approach can lead to an
   agro-environmental inventory, which is consistent with national level
   estimates and still has the advantage of being disaggregated to specific
   farm types. Conventional dairy farm types in general emitted more
   nitrate but less phosphate compared with pig farm types. The methane
   emission was higher from dairy farm types compared with all other farm
   types. In general the conventional dairy farms emitted more nitrate,
   ammonia, and nitrous oxide, compared with organic dairy farms. (c) 2006

Title = {{Emergy evaluations of Denmark and Danish agriculture: Assessing the

Abstract = {{This paper presents emergy evaluations of Denmark and Danish agriculture
   for the years 1936, 1970 and 1999. The evaluations highlight the
   changing relationship between agriculture and society over the time
   period studied. A large increase in total emergy supporting the Danish
   economy was observed, and the 379\% rise from 1936 to 1999 in emergy use
   per capita, a biophysical measure of living standard, came from both
   imported sources and from the non-renewable storages of the biosphere.
   In 1936, Danish agriculture was largely based on the use of draft
   animals for traction and approximately 1,10,000,000 person-hours of
   direct labor were required for production, while in 1970 and 1999, all
   traction was mechanized and approximately 415,000,000 and 12 1,000,000
   person-hours were required for production, respectively. Over the same
   period, the emergy supporting each person-hour of agricultural labor
   increased by 1600\%. The driving forces for agricultural production
   shifted towards an increased reliance on commercial energy and indirect
   labor. Given the increase in emergy available to the Danish economy
   through extraction and use of domestic oil and gas and trade over the
   period studied, the shift in labor from agriculture to the service and
   manufacturing sectors represented a nation-wide re-organization for
   maximum empower. The evaluations also indicate that while agriculture
   remains an essential way for industrial economies to capture local
   renewable resources, given the limited net emeray yields of agricultural
   production, the magnitude of non-agricultural economic activity that
   agriculture systems can support appears limited in an economy with
   access to high-net-yield imported energy resources. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The current study focuses on the influence of geopolitical coordination
   of conservation strategies on cost and efficiency in terms of species
   representation when selecting network of protected areas. Conservation
   policies in the EU are implemented at many different administrative
   levels: from the European Union and national levels, to regional
   or/county levels within member countries. This arise the question what
   size of efficiency gains could be achieved if planning of conservation
   priorities could be coordinated between geopolitical units. Using data
   for the nationwide distribution of 763 species, representing all Danish
   species within eight taxa, we compared illustrative costs for the
   addition of new areas to the existing conservation network in order to
   ensure full coverage of all species. We found that the cost of
   independent regional planning is 20-fold higher than an inter-regional
   and nationally co-ordinated strategy. we also found that substituting
   land prices for a simple land-area measure in our analyses increased the
   expected conservation costs differential significantly, without
   increasing coverage of species representations. We suggest that in
   economic and biodiversity terms it can largely be a win-win situation to
   set a common goal, to develop priority-strategies, and to coordinate
   actions at higher rather than lower levels of administration. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{During the last decades, development of Danish agriculture was
   characterised by concentration of land on fewer and larger farms and
   consequently increasing farm sizes. On basis of three case studies
   supplemented by national data we explore relationships between farm size
   change and farmland nature in terms of field sizes and hedgerow
   densities. Data point to a significant relationship between farm
   enlargement and increases in mean field sizes. Furthermore, mean field
   size is negatively related to densities of hedgerows. For the coming
   decades, scenarios for Danish agriculture point to a continued increase
   in farm sizes. We argue for an increased focus on the effects of a
   continued scale enlargement on farmland nature in terms of changes in
   field size structure. In order to reduce harmful influences of scale
   enlargement, we suggest that in relation to changes in field structure,
   agricultural policies should focus on restrictions on removal of old
   hedgerows and on subsidies for planting of new hedgerows.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we show the quantitative and relative importance of
   phosphorus (P) losses from agricultural areas within European river
   basins and demonstrate the importance of P pathways, linking
   agricultural source areas to surface water at different scales.
   Agricultural P losses are increasingly important for the P concentration
   in most European rivers, lakes, and estuaries, even though the quantity
   of P lost from agricultural areas in European catchments varies at least
   one order of magnitude (< 0.2 kg P ha(-1) to > 2.1 kg P ha(-1)). We
   focus on the importance of P for the implementation of the EU Water
   Framework Directive and discuss the benefits, uncertainties, and side
   effects of the different targeted mitigation measures that can be
   adopted to combat P losses from agricultural areas in river basins.
   Experimental evidence of the effects of some of the main targeted
   mitigation measures hitherto implemented is demonstrated, including: (i)
   soil tillage changes, (ii) treatment of soils near ditches and streams
   with iron to reduce P transport from source areas to surface waters,
   (iii) establishment of buffer zones for retaining P from surface runoff,
   (iv) restoration of river-floodplain systems to allow natural inundation
   of riparian areas and deposition of P, and (v) inundation of riparian
   areas with tile drainage water for P retention. Furthermore, we show how
   river basin managers can map and analyze the extent and importance of P
   risk areas, exemplified by four catchments differing in size in Norway,
   Denmark, and the Netherlands. Finally, we discuss the factors and
   mechanisms that may delay and/or counteract the responses of mitigation
   measures for combating P losses from agricultural areas when monitored
   at the catchment scale.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticide leaching is an important process with respect to contamination
   risk to the aquatic environment. The risk of leaching was thus evaluated
   for glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl-glycine) and its degradation product
   AMPA (amino-methylphosphonic acid) under field conditions at one sandy
   and two loamy sites. Over a 2-yr period, tile-drainage water, ground
   water, and soil water were sampled and analyzed for pesticides. At a
   sandy site, the strong soil sorption capacity and lack of macropores
   seemed to prevent leaching of both glyphosate and AMPA. At one loamy
   site, which received low precipitation with little intensity, the
   residence time within the root zone seemed sufficient to prevent
   leaching of glyphosate, probably due to degradation and sorption. Minor
   leaching of AMPA was observed at this site, although the concentration
   was generally low, being on the order of 0.05 mu g L-1 or less. At
   another loamy site, however, glyphosate and AMPA leached from the root
   zone into the tile drains (I m below ground surface {[}BGS]) in average
   concentrations exceeding 0.1 mu g L-1, which is the EU threshold value
   for drinking water. The leaching of glyphosate was mainly governed by
   pronounced macropore flow occurring within the first months after
   application. AMPA was frequently detected more than 1.5 yr after
   application, thus indicating a minor release and limited degradation
   capacity within the soil. Leaching has so far been confined to the depth

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Rapid agricultural change in western Europe has occurred in the last
   three decades, at cost to farmland biodiversity, particularly birds.
   This study reviewed agricultural change in Denmark from 1983 to 2001, to
   compare patterns of intensification and farmland bird abundance with the
   UK.
   2. Changes in 26 agricultural variables summarized using principal
   components analysis (PCA) showed consistent changes throughout the
   period that were similar to the UK. Pig and sheep production, and the
   extent of winter cereals, rape and fodder maize, all increased. The area
   used to grow fodder beet and spring barley, the applications of
   agrochemicals and the numbers of cattle reared all declined. The
   greatest change in land area in Denmark was the switch from spring- to
   autumn-sown cereals in the 1980s, almost a decade later than in the UK.
   3. PCA described changes in annual indices of bird abundance based on
   Danish point count surveys from 1983 to 2001, which were most marked
   during 1983-90, after which ordination values varied little despite
   continued agricultural change. Of 27 bird species associated with
   farmland habitat in Denmark, five declined, 10 showed stable trends and
   12 increased, compared with 15, eight and four, respectively, among the
   same species in the UK.
   4. Agricultural yields have been sustained or enhanced during the survey
   period, while most farmland bird species declining in the UK have
   remained stable or increased in Denmark. Of the five declining Danish
   species, only lapwing Vanellus vanellus and yellowhammer Emberiza
   citrinella are associated with predominantly farmland habitat. The
   timing of the declines suggests that the switch to autumn sowing in
   Denmark has had little effect on any species.
   5. In contrast to the UK, pesticide and inorganic fertilizer use has
   declined and organic farming has expanded in Denmark since 1983,
   coinciding with the period of stability/increase in farmland bird
   abundance. It is not possible to establish any causality from this
   analysis.
   6. The ability of species showing marked declines in Europe to maintain
   their number and distribution in the Danish landscape in the face of
   agricultural intensification gives some optimism for safeguarding
   farmland birds and biodiversity in the future. However, we need to
   understand the reasons behind contrasting population trends in Denmark
   and the UK.
   7. Synthesis and applications. Marked differences between national
   patterns of agriculture and the contrasting nature of historical
   intensification offer the opportunity to contrast the effects of major
   changes in land-use practice on European farmland biodiversity.
   Appropriate comparative and individual studies of the effects of changes
   in specific agricultural management at greater spatial (i.e.
   supranational) scales are necessary in order to underpin the successful
   development of future European agricultural policies that will sustain
   and enhance agricultural yields whilst maintaining farmland
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural production and its associated land use comprise the most
   important key factor regarding biodiversity and environmental impact
   within the wider countryside in Denmark. Recently, a number of options
   for land use changes have been implemented in environmental actionplans,
   such as afforestation, restoring wetlands and protection of drinking
   water catchments. At the same time. growing attention is put on the
   potential of Geographic Information System (GIS) as spatial decision
   Support tools in local and regional environmental impact assessment,
   planning and implementation of governmental policies at local level. The
   work presented is part of a multidisciplinary research project,
   addressing the consequences of changes in agricultural production with
   respect to ecology, environment and economy. In this paper, focus is put
   upon linking vegetation ecology and farm economy. Ecological effects are
   assessed in terms of type, area and fragmentation of biotopes at
   landscape level. Assessment is based upon the output of a spatial
   detailed Biotope Landscape Model, describing the distribution of plant
   communities and nature types in Danish (semi-) natural terrestrial
   biotopes. In addition ail agro-economic model, assessing the costs of
   agricultural land use changes at the farm level, has been implemented.
   Input and output of the economic model has been linked to the GIS-based
   Biotope Landscape Model, allowing scenario definition and integrated
   evaluation of results, including their spatial representation. The
   present situation has been modelled as a base line scenario. Afterwards,
   three scenarios aiming at more extensive agricultural production have
   been selected so they reflect different ecological or economic
   priorities. Results show economic as well as ecological consequences,
   compared to the present situation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{79-94}},

Abstract = {{The paper argues for the existence of two powerful discourses of
   rurality in Denmark after World War II. The first one is termed the
   modernist-agriculturalist discourse. Although still influential in the
   current public debate, in Denmark as well as in other Western European
   countries, this discourse of rurality had its heyday in the 1960s. It is
   based on key words, such as structural changes, development and vertical
   integration. Since the 1950s, it has belonged to groups of Danish
   farmers who use a productionist terminology in the public debate.
   However, the paper mainly focuses on a second discourse of rurality,
   established during the 1970s. Based on key words, such as community,
   culture, environment and active citizenship, this terminology was
   applied and promoted by new non-agricultural elites in the villages and
   can therefore be termed the non-agriculturalist discourse of rurality.
   The paper shows how this new `family' of powerful words was developed
   and promoted by The National Confederation of Village Communities in
   rural Denmark (Landssammenslutningen af Landsbysamfund or L.A.L.),
   established in 1976. Thus, from the late 1970s, members of this
   organization contributed to build and apply a peculiar L.A.L. vocabulary
   in their journal Landsbyen ({''}The village{''})-a vocabulary which
   later was to be disseminated among the population and, finally, to have
   a significant impact on state politics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Based on a review of its history, its present structure and its
   objective in the future, agroecology is defined as an integrative
   discipline that includes elements from agronomy, ecology, sociology and
   economics. Agroecology's credentials as a separate scientific discipline
   were measured against the norms of science, defined by Robert King
   Merton (1973): communalism, universality, disinterestedness, originality
   and doubt. It is concluded that agroecology meets many of these norms
   and where it differs, it does so in a way that perhaps anticipates the
   manner and the direction in which the social position of science is
   changing.
   Accepting agroecology as a separate scientific discipline, the two main
   issues with which it must contend were considered to be those of scaling
   and interdisciplinarity. Scaling is a problem because results of
   agroecological research are typically generated at small spatial scales
   whereas applications are frequently implemented in larger,
   administrative units. A framework to convey information from science to
   decision-makers was proposed and tested in a case study of farm energy
   use. Interdisciplinarity is a problem because researchers from different
   disciplines see the world from different viewpoints, use different
   language, work at different locations and use different criteria to
   evaluate one another's work. Progress in this area is likely to be slow
   and driven by the need to justify the value of science to society. (C)

Abstract = {{The industrialisation and intensification of agriculture over the last
   50 years had a negative impact on landscape diversity and habitat
   values. During the last two decades, farmers have become increasingly
   engaged in landscape activities, to maintain or create habitats on their
   property. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship
   between landscape changes in rural areas and farm characteristics. In
   addition, the results are used to determine if farms with certain farm
   characteristics or combinations of characteristics can be related to
   different patterns of landscape changes. The analysis is based on a case
   study of the landscape activities carried out by 104 farmers between
   1990 and 1995 in two parishes in central Jutland, Denmark. A
   multivariate analysis, consisting of a multiple correspondence analysis
   (MCA) and cluster analysis, is used to identify groups of farmers with
   distinct farm characteristics and landscape activities. The results
   indicate that 57\% of the farms in the study area had engaged in
   landscape activities. Hedgerow planting and removal, and water point
   digging and cleaning were the most popular activities in terms of number
   of farmers involved. The planting of Christmas trees and cultivation of
   permanent grassland covered the largest area. In total, the activities
   concerned 125 ha or 1.5\% of the study area. A parameter to parameter
   relationship could be identified between some landscape activities and
   farm characteristics. In particular, forest removal was closely related
   to intensive arable production while a range of activities were
   correlated with ``hobby{''} farm characteristics. The results indicate
   that a range of motives influence farmers' landscape activities and that
   more information is needed to understand and model complex
   decision-making processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In a number of European countries, including Denmark, the practice of
   planting hedgerows has a long tradition, and hedgerows form significant
   structures of semi-natural elements in a matrix of arable land. In
   Denmark an institutionalised framework has developed in relation to a
   subsidy scheme encouraging farmers to plant hedgerows. This article
   analyses the planting practice as a social system; giving emphasis to
   the interactions between actors and how this affects the current
   planting activity. Combining an overall description of the nationwide
   network with a detailed case study in Jutland, Denmark enables an
   understanding of how the local planting practice is influenced by the
   local context and the nationwide network, and at the same time
   contributes to the reproduction of the entire network. It is concluded
   that the planting activity is characterised by routines, professionalism
   and division of labour. The local actors involved perceive the activity
   as a success, and do not question current practise. However, the actors
   are not aware of the potential consequences of the planting practice at
   the landscape scale. Even though hedgerows are planted through so-called
   planting associations related to defined local areas the placement of
   hedgerows is not co-ordinated and evaluated at a landscape scale. In
   addition, the composition of hedgerows is standardised at a national
   level, and the individual farmer makes few adjustments. Thus, the sense
   of local landscape identity may become blurred. The increasing public
   attention towards a multiplicity of functions in the agricultural
   landscape implies further development of the potential positive
   landscape effects of hedgerows in a local context. This may induce
   changes in the relationships between actors and eventually the planting
   practice. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All fights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The last 50 years of agricultural intensification has had a serious
   impact on the agricultural landscapes of Europe, resulting in a decrease
   in landscape heterogeneity and habitat quality. Increasing awareness of
   the negative environmental impact of industrialised agriculture during
   the past two decades has led to the protection of many vulnerable areas.
   Several agri-environmental programmes have been implemented which
   provide economic incentives for farmers to improve habitat conditions.
   This paper investigates landscape changes undertaken by farmers on their
   land in a study area in central Jutland, Denmark in a ten-year period,
   in order to determine the type and magnitude of fanner involvement in
   landscape activities. The results indicate that more than half of the
   farmers were involved in landscape activities between 1987 and 1997.
   Hedgerow planting and removal and digging of ponds were the most
   important activities in terms of proportion of farmers involved.
   Planting of Christmas trees and conversion of agricultural land into
   permanent grassland were the most significant activities in terms of
   area concerned. Few full-time farmers were engaged in activities which
   required the conversion of land to non-agricultural land use. Many
   landscape activities were financially supported by public subsidies
   which therefore appear to be quite important. Very few farmers had
   entered into management agreements under the EU 2078/92 programme.}},

Abstract = {{The recent decline in species richness in (semi)-natural habitats in
   northern Europe has largely been attributable to habitat destruction,
   and to subsequent limitation in seed dispersal among fragments. However,
   some habitat types were probably split up already in the historical
   landscape, but the segregated parts were probably not isolated to the
   present degree. This paper seeks evidence for livestock as vectors for
   propagules at 3 spatial scales in the past cultural landscape. Three
   main scales at which livestock acted as seed dispersers are important:
   free movement in the landscape (1 -10 km), driving animals to mast
   feeding or to manors (10-50 km), and the export of living animals
   (hundreds of km). The emerging picture is for most plant species a
   dramatically decreased chance of dispersal in the modern landscape. The
   consequence is probably decreasing species richness in (semi)-natural
   plant communities, such as pasture, meadow, and heathland.}},

Abstract = {{The Agenda 2000 reform, agreed on by the EU government leaders in the

   The reform involves both reductions in price support and compensations
   in the form of hectare and animal support. The Agenda 2000 reform may
   have considerable environmental and economic effects, and in this
   article we assess these effects. Within an integrated model system, we
   calculate environmental effects (changes in nitrogen loading in the
   terrestrial environment and the Danish marine waters, changes in oxygen
   concentrations in the inner Danish marine waters, and changes in
   emissions of the greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide), as well
   as economic effects (effects on private consumption, GDP, the balance of
   payments, and employment). The results indicate that the Agenda 2000
   reform has significant economic costs but almost no effects on the
   environment-either positive or negative. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Biotic and abiotic factors causing aggregations of butterflies were
   investigated in a variety of uncultivated habitats on an organic farm in
   Denmark. By combining the method of butterfly transect counting with
   multiple regression analysis, environmental and floral variables
   influencing butterfly abundance in linear and non-linear uncultivated
   habitats were identified. Dependent variables were: butterfly totals,
   Thymelicus spp. (mainly T. lineola), Aphantopus hyperantus, Maniola
   jurtina, Pieris rapae/napi and four mobility groups. In linear habitats,
   environmental variables of major importance were: insolation, width of
   non-crop ground vegetation and abundance of nectar sources, while in
   non-linear habitats these were: larval host plants, presence of stream
   and degree of grazing. Among the preferred nectar sources were: Knautia
   arvensis, Trifolium pratense, Cirsium spp. and Hieracium pilosella. Most
   butterfly species had significantly higher abundances in non-linear
   habitats compared to linear habitats. The impact of different
   environmental and floral variables on the butterfly fauna is discussed,
   emphasizing the major importance of certain habitat types and
   characteristics for the butterfly species inhabiting uncultivated
   habitats surrounded by cultivated fields. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ever increasing attention is being paid to the environmental impact of
   intensive agricultural practices, and in this context organic farming is
   gaining recognition as a relatively friendly production system. In
   general, the risk of harmful environmental effects is lower with organic
   than with conventional farming methods, though not necessarily so. This
   review examines organic fanning in the light of European conditions with
   special regard to recent research findings from Denmark. It specifies
   the environmental problems caused by modern farming practices and
   discusses appropriate indicators for assessing their impact. A driving
   force-state-response (DSR) framework is employed to organise and
   understand the processes and mechanisms that lie behind the impact of
   agriculture on nature and the environment. Important groups of
   environmental indicators are selected that characterise (a) the aquatic
   environment (nitrate and phosphorus leaching), (b) the soil (organic
   matter, biology and structure), (c) the ecosystem (arable land,
   semi-cultivated areas, small biotopes and landscape), and (d) resource
   usage and balances (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and energy use).
   The paper also reviews several empirical studies. With regard to soil
   biology, organic farming is usually associated with a significantly
   higher level of biological activity (bacteria (Monera), fungi (Mycota),
   springtails (Collembola), mites (Arachnida), earthworms (Lumbricus
   terrestris)), due to its versatile crop rotations, reduced applications
   of nutrients, and the ban on pesticides. In most cases there is also a
   lower surplus of nutrients and less leaching with organic than with
   conventional farming. However, poor management (e.g., the ploughing of
   grass and legumes (Fabates) at the wrong time of year with no subsequent
   crops to capture the mineralised nitrogen), low self-sufficiency in
   feed, and problems with certain production systems (such as those
   involved in organic pig farming, i.e., grazing sows, low crop yields),
   can lead to a high level of leaching in some organic systems. Organic
   farming is faced with a need to expand and develop in line with
   increasing demands for organic food and growing environmental concerns.
   This requires closer attention to the goals, values and principles on
   which organic practices are based, and more research into the influence
   of organic farming on different aspects of the environment. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The farmer as a producer has traditionally been in focus when changes in
   agricultural landscapes are studied. Decisions on husbandry, rotational
   systems, machinery, fertilisation and pest management do indeed affect
   the landscape in crucial ways and landscape dynamics cannot be
   understood if the farmer's decision making and the surrounding
   technology, socioeconomics, and organisational structure are ignored.
   However, normally the farmer is not the only decision maker. Often he
   farms leased land and the owner may be an equally important actor
   concerning landscape changes. Even when the farmer and the owner are the
   same person, the `owner' may take very different types of decisions than
   the `producer' does. Many of these decisions concern the landscape as a
   `living place' (in the sense of a place to live in) rather than as a
   production area. Decisions linked to the landscape as a living place
   have been overlooked in landscape research, yet are playing a growing
   role due to occupational changes in the countryside and changes in
   agricultural subsidies (from production to land-based subsidies), and to
   the growing interest in environmental protection and enhancement, I
   argue that the owner is a key person in changes of the structural part
   of the landscape and should be included in landscape research and also
   be considered as a key actor by the planning authorities. Empirical data
   from an extensive interview survey of 700 farmland and woodland owners
   in Denmark are used to support the argument, and finally some
   implications for landscape planning and public regulations are
   discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Farmers lack well documented sets of farm level indicators to allow
   their own evaluation of environmental impact and to stimulate the
   development of more environment friendly farming practices. A set of
   farm level indicators of resource use and environmental impact on
   livestock farms was developed as part of a decision aid for farmers. The
   indicators were meant to be part of an extended farm account and
   included the surpluses and efficiencies of N, P and Cu, the energy use
   per kg grain and per kg milk or meat, pesticide treatment index (TFI),
   \% unsprayed area, \% small biotopes on the farm, and \% weeds in grain
   crops. The indicators were tested on 20 Danish dairy and pig farms over
   a period of 3 years in order to see if they were suitable for use in the
   farmer's management. The third year, farm gate surpluses varied between
   89 and 265 kg N ha(-1), 2 and 31 kg P ha(-1) and 0.1 and 0.8 kg Cu
   ha(-1). Energy use varied between 2.1 and 4.1 MJ kg(-1) milk and between
   14 and 20 MJ kg(-1) live weight pig sold. For all indicators, except
   energy use per kg grain, the variation in indicator levels between farms
   was more important than the variation between years within each farm.
   There was significant variation between farms after correction for
   stocking rates and soil-and farm types, which suggests that the
   indicators reflect differences in management practise on comparable
   farms. It was demonstrated that these differences between similar farms
   and between the years on the individual farms might be explained by the
   detailed knowledge of management of the farms' different subsystems
   (herd and crops). The information given by the indicators is discussed
   from environmental and management points of view and problems of
   defining and interpreting the indicators are identified. Given further
   development of indicators for soil quality and nature values, the farm
   level indicators seem a promising way of enabling farmers to include
   environmental topics in their management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Since 1950, Danish agriculture has increased its production, and has
   become very specialized and highly and consistenly productive both per
   unit area and per unit resource. The negative effects of agriculture are
   starting to weigh too heavily on the environment, e.g. fertilizer
   residues in water, pesticides in food and water, and resource use. In
   order to reduce the loss of nutrients and change the landscape to
   facilitate higher biodiversity, several national programs have been set
   up between 1980 and 1990. In 1987, the first Danish law to introduce
   organic farming was approved. Sustainable development has two sides, the
   well-being of human society, and that of the natural environment. A
   third component explicitly includes succeeding generations. We conclude
   that the intentions of sustainable development are more easily
   formulated than the means by which they can be achieved. Our final
   conclusion is that radical change of direction in Danish agriculture is
   not apparent at present nor is such a change likely to happen quickly,
   even if desired, because of social and economic resistances.}},

Abstract = {{Dutch and Danish governments have applied a combination of voluntary and

   development of more eco-friendly agriculture. This has brought the
   post-war intensification process in both countries to a halt, and to
   some extent even resulted in extensification. Voluntary environmental
   regulation aims at informing, educating and advising farmers or at
   influencing then values and attitudes. Such measures are often regarded
   as unimportant and inefficient, but recent surveys among farmers in
   Denmark and the Netherlands, and analysis of farmer study group schemes
   in both countries, question this assumption. A process of change in
   farmers' behaviour and attitudes can be observed, and voluntary measures
   seem to have played an important part. Farmers in close contact with
   extension, farmers participating in study groups, and `green' farmers
   have shifted more quickly and decisively to eco-friendly methods than

Abstract = {{The concept of sustainability is widely used in agriculture, There is,
   however, a large variability in the interpretation of the meaning of
   sustainability. The broad understanding in conjunction with the
   complexity of livestock farming calls for a systems approach.
   In this paper different interpretation of sustainable agriculture is
   described and discussed It is concluded that sustainable agriculture has
   a major normative dimension and obviously has different meanings for
   different groups in society. Using sustainability in a systems
   describing concept, one has to be very aware of the normative dimension.
   With a starting point in farm models previously described in this
   journal a model is introduced where the farm is shown in the centre and
   put into perspective with other groups in the whole society. The other
   group represents different perceptions of sustainable agriculture. These
   perceptions might be in conflict with each other and for with the
   observed farm. The idea is then to analyse and forecast in which
   direction the dominant perception of sustainability will be moving. It
   is suggested that this can be analysed be means of the discourse
   concepts, which come from social science.
   A key point in the model is that the farm is considered as a learning
   human activity system where the farmer reconsiders or reflects his
   current management in the light of the change in society, In Denmark the
   dominant perception of agricultural sustainability has changed towards
   the environmental issues during the last 20 years. As a consequence of
   this change different indicators have been developed for the purpose of
   describing and stimulating self reflection concerning environmental
   issues at farm level. These environmental indicators are presented and
   discussed through examples. Finally, an approach of including a variety
   of productions systems (i.e. both conventional and organic farming
   systems) in conjunction with researchers from a variety of disciplines
   is described.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL \& ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{30-51}},
Abstract = {{Separate focus on crop fertilization or feeding practices inadequately
   describes nitrogen (N) loss from mixed dairy farms because of (1)
   interaction between animal and crop production and between the
   production system and the manager, and (2) uncertainties of herd N
   production and crop N utilization. Therefore a systems approach was used
   to study N turnover and N efficiency on. 16 conventional and 14 organic
   private Danish farms with mixed animal (dairy) and crop production.
   There were significant differences in N surplus at the fan level (242
   kg. N/ha. vs. 124 kg. N/ha. on conventional and organic dairy farms
   respectively) with a correlation. between stocking rate and N surplus. N
   efficiency was calculated as the output of N in animal products divided
   by the net N import in fodder, manure and fertilizer. N turnover in herd
   and individual crops calculated on selected farms showed differences in
   organic and conventional crop N utilization. This is explained via a
   discussion of the rationality behind the current way of planning the
   `'optimum fertilizer application'' in conventional agriculture. The
   concept of marginal N efficiency is insufficient for correcting problems
   of N loss from dairy farms. Substantial reductions in N loss from
   conventional mixed dairy farms is probably unlikely without lower
   production intensity. The concept of mean farm unit N efficiency might
   be a way to describe the relation between production and N loss to
   facilitate regulation. This concept is linked to differing goals of
   agricultural development-i.e. intensification. and separation vs.
   extensification and integration. It is discussed how studies in private
   farms-using organic farms as selected critical cases-can demonstrate
   possibilities for balancing production and environmental concern.}},

Abstract = {{The Danish landscape, and most central European landscapes, are
   agricultural landscapes. They developed and they still change almost
   exclusively according to the conditions of agriculture. Despite the
   traditional resistance from farming organisations, governments have
   begun to impose regulations on farming practice to maintain
   environmental qualities. A survey of the existing and forthcoming
   environmental regulation of agriculture in four European countries has
   been carried out to discuss this regulation in relation to the
   possibilities of integrated landscape management of agricultural land.
   An analysis of the different measures showed that regulation is
   definitely increasing in all countries, but that it does not favour a
   coherent landscape management. Regulation appears to be implemented by
   top-down administration, generating a growing bureaucracy, and
   considerable amounts are spent, often with low goal-achievement. Finally
   it can be seen that land-use planning is a prerequisite to several
   regulation procedures. Based on these findings, a proposal is made for
   an integrated planning process on agricultural lands. The main focus
   should be on the collaboration with local farming societies and on the
   local implementation of general environmental requirements.}},
